4. In any proceeding, judicial, arbitral or otherwise, concerning a legal investment dispute between it and a national or company of the other Party, A Party Shall not assert, as a defense, counterclaim, right of set-off or otherwise, that the national or company concerned has received or Will receive, pursuant to an insurance contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of its alleged damages from any third Party whatsoever, whether public or private, including such other Party and its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities.

PROTOCOL*  
 
On signing the Treaty concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments, the Arab Republic of Egypt and the United States of America have, in addition, agreed on the following provisions which should be regarded as an integral part of the Treaty:  
 
1. Each Party reserves the right to deny the benefits of this Treaty to any company of either Party, or its affiliates or subsidiaries, if nationals of any third country control such company, affiliate or subsidiary; provided that, whenever one Party concludes that the benefits of this Treaty should not be extended for this reason, it shall promptly consult with the other Party to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter.  

2. "Control" means to have a substantial share of ownership rights and the ability to exercise decisive influence. Differences as to the existence of control shall be resolved according to the provisions of Article VIII.  

3.

	(a) The treatment accorded by the United States to nationals or companies of Egypt under the provisions of Article II (1) and (2) shall in any State of the United States or other territory, possession, or political or administrative subdivision of the United States be the treatment accorded therein to residents of or companies incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized in other States of the United States or territories, possessions, or political or administrative subdivisions of the United States.  

	(b) The treatment accorded by Egypt to nationals and companies of the United States with respect to the establishment and acquisition of investments in limited sensitive geographic areas designated for exclusive Egyptian investment shall be no less favorable than the treatment it accords to investments of nationals and companies of any third country. Egypt reserves the right to modify the areas covered, provided that such areas will be kept to a minimum and will not substantially impair the investment opportunities of United States nationals and companies.  

4. The provisions of Article II, paragraph 3, relating to most favored nation treatment, shall not apply to advantages accorded by either Party to nationals or companies of a third country by virtue of a special security or regional arrangement, including regional customs unions or free trade areas. Further, these provisions do not apply to the ownership of real estate. The provisions of Article II paragraph 1, relating to most favored nation treatment, shall not be construed to oblige one Party to extend to nationals or companies of the other the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege which may be extended by the former  Party by virtue of  a customs union or in the field of housing. Moreover, with regard to rights to engage in mining on the public domain, each Party retains the right to accord to nationals or companies of the other Party treatment which is like or similar to that accorded by the other Party to nationals or companies of the first Party.  

5. It is understood that this Treaty does not derogate from the rights of either Party regarding the establishment of qualifications as for the practice of professions, including law and accountancy. These qualifications may confine the practice of such professions to nationals or companies of a Party, provided that they are applied on a nondiscriminatory basis; and provided, further, that such nationality requirements do not derogate from the right of nationals and companies of either Party, pursuant to Article II (5)(b) to engage professional and technical personnel of their choice to render professional and technical services necessary for the internal planning and operation of the investment.  

6. This Treaty, and in particular, the provisions of Article II, paragraph 5 (b) shall be subjected to the provisions of Article X.

7. With respect to Article II (6), performance requirements are conditions imposed which would require an investor to export a minimum percentage of final product or to source some inputs locally.  

8. With regard to Article III, paragraph 1(d) the term "prompt" does not necessarily mean instantaneous. The intent is that the Party diligently and expeditiously carry out any necessary formalities.  

9. With regard to Article III, paragraph 1, the phrase "events that constituted or resulted in the expropriatory action" refers to conduct attributable to the expropriatory Party and not to conduct of the national or company, The inclusion of subparagraph (e) in Article III, paragraph 1, is without prejudice to the measure of compensation due in the event of expropriation.  

10. The Parties recognize that restrictions on transfers abroad of sales or liquidation proceeds of an investment will adversely affect future capital inflows, contrary to the spirit of this Treaty and the interests of the Party imposing those restrictions.

Nevertheless, the Parties recognize that it is possible that the Arab Republic of Egypt may find its foreign exchange reserves at a very low level. In these circumstances, the Arab Republic of Egypt may temporarily delay transfers required under Article V, Paragraph 1(f), but only:

		(i) in a manner not less favorable that accorded to comparable transfers to investors of third countries;

		(ii) to the extent and for the time period necessary to restore its reserves to a minimally acceptable level, but in no case for period of time longer than that permitted by the provisions of Law 43 in force on the date of signature of this Treaty; and (iii) after providing the investor an opportunity to invest the sales or liquidation proceeds in a manner which will preserve their real value free of exchange risk until transfer occurs.  

11. Concerning Article VII (3)(a)(ii), it is understood that the Parties to the dispute may previously agree to submission of the dispute to the jurisdiction of domestic courts and tribunals. The Parties will maintain a nondiscriminatory policy regarding the inclusion and implementation of such provisions in any investment contract.  

12. With regard to the Annex, the exceptions noted by the Arab Republic of Egypt under "commercial activity" do not include integrated operations which combine production and sales activities for their products.  

13. Recognizing that international financial markets and institutions further stimulate the process of economic development through the international transmission of investment and associated technology, each Party undertakes to maintain a favorable environment for investment by nationals or companies of the other Party in the insurance and banking sectors. Therefore,  each Party accords to investments by nationals or companies of the other Party in investment banks, merchant-banks and reinsurance companies whose activities are confined to transactions in foreign currencies treatment no less favorable than that accorded under existing laws and regulations to investments by its own nationals and companies or to investments by nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the more favorable. Both Parties agree to hold future discussions concerning the expansion of investment possibilities in these sectors by nationals or companies of either Party in the territory of the other Party.

PROTOCOL  
 
The Protocol is changed to read as follows:  

On signing the Treaty concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments, the Arab Republic  of Egypt and the United States of America, have, in addition, agreed on the following provisions which should be regarded as an integral part of this Treaty:  

1. Each Party reserves the right to deny the benefits of this Treaty to any company of either Party, or its affiliates or subsidiaries, if nationals of any third country control such company, affiliate or subsidiary; provided that, whenever one Party concludes that the benefits of this Treaty should not be extended for this reason, it shall promptly consult with the other Party to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter.  

2. "Control" means to have a substantial share of ownership rights and the ability to exercise decisive influence. Differences as to the existence of control shall be resolved according to the provisions of Article VIII.  

3.

	(a) The treatment accorded by the United States to nationals or companies of Egypt under the provisions of Article II(l) and (2) shall in any State of the United States or other territory, possession, or political or administrative subdivision of the United States be the treatment accorded therein to residents of or companies incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized in other States of the United States or territories, possessions, or political or administrative subdivisions of the United States.  

	(b) The treatment accorded by Egypt to nationals and companies of the United States with respect to the establishment and acquisition of investments in limited sensitive geographic areas designated for exclusive Egyptian investment shall be no less favorable then the treatment it accords to investments of nationals and companies of any third country. Egypt reserves the right to modify the areas covered, provided that such areas will be kept to a minimum and will not substantially impair the investment opportunities of United States nationals and companies.  

4. The provisions of Article II, paragraph 3,  relating to most favored nation treatment, shall not apply to advantages accorded by either Party to nationals or companies of a third country by virtue of a specific security or regional arrangement, including regional customs unions or free trade areas. Further, these provisions do not apply to the ownership of real estate. The provisions of Article II paragraph 1, relating to most favored nation treatment, shall not be construed to oblige one Party to extend to nationals or companies of the other the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege which may be extended by the former  Party by virtue of a customs union or in the field of housing. Moreover, with regard to rights to engage in mining on the public domain, each Party retains the right to accord to nationals or companies of the other Party treatment which is like or similar to that accorded by the other Party to nationals or companies of the first Party.  

5. It is understood that this Treaty does not derogate from the rights of either Party regarding the establishment of qualifications as for the practice of professions, including law and accountancy. These qualifications may confine the practice of such professions to nationals or companies of. a Party, provided that they are applied on a nondiscriminatory basis; and provided, further, that such nationality requirements do not derogate from the right of nationals and companies of either Party, pursuant to Article II (5)(b) to engage professional and technical personnel of their choice to render professional and technical services necessary for the internal planning and operation of the investment.  

6. This Treaty, and in particular, the provisions of Article II, paragraph 5(b) shall be subject to the provisions of Article X.  

7. With respect to Article II (6), performance requirements are conditions imposed which would require an investor to export a minimum percentage of final product or to source some inputs locally.  

8. With regard to Article III, paragraph 1(d) the term "prompt" does not necessarily mean instantaneous. The intent is that the Party diligently and expeditiously carry out any necessary formalities.  

9. With regard to Article III, paragraph 1,  the phrase "events that constituted or resulted in the expropriatory action" refers to conduct attributable to the expropriatory Party and not to conduct of the national or company. The inclusion of paragraph (e) in Article III, paragraph 1, is without prejudice to the measure of compensation due in the event of expropriation.  

10. The Parties recognize that restrictions on transfers abroad of sales or liquidation proceeds of an investment will adversely affect future capital inflows, contrary to the spirit of this Treaty and the interests of the Party imposing those restrictions. Nevertheless, the Parties recognize that it is possible that the Arab Republic of Egypt may find its foreign exchange reserves at a very low level. In these circumstances, the Arab Republic of Egypt may temporarily delay transfers required under Article V, Paragraph l(f), but only: (i) in a manner not less favorable than that accorded to comparable transfers to investors of third countries; (ii) to the extent and for the time period n to restore its reserves to a minimally acceptable level, but in no case for period of time longer than that permitted by the provisions of Law 43 in force on the date of signature of this Treaty; and (iii) after providing the investor an opportunity to invest the sales or liquidation proceeds in a manner which will preserve their real value free of exchange risk until transfer occurs.  

11. Concerning Article VII (3 )(a)(ii), it is understood that the Parties to the dispute may Previously agree to submission of the dispute to the jurisdiction of domestic courts and tribunals. The Parties will maintain a nondiscriminatory policy regarding the inclusion and implementation of such provisions in any investment contract.  

12. With regard to the Annex, the exceptions noted by the Arab Republic of Egypt under "commercial activity" do not include integrated operations which combine production and sales activities for their products.  

13. Recognizing that international financial markets and institutions further stimulate the process of economic development through the international transmission of investment and associated technology, each Party undertakes to maintain a favorable environment for investment by nationals or companies of the other Party in the insurance and banking sectors. Therefore,  each Party accords to investments by nationals or companies of the other Party in investment banks, merchant-banks and reinsurance companies whose activities are confined to transactions in foreign currencies treatment no less favorable than that accorded under existing laws and regulations to investments by its own nationals and companies or to investments by nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the more favorable. Both Parties agree to hold future discussions concerning the expansion of investment possibilities in these sectors by nationals or companies of either Party in the territory of the other Party.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT,  
MINISTER OF PLANNING AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION,

Hon. WILLIAM E. BROCK,  US. Trade Representative,  
Washington, D.C.  
 
DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR,  
 
As part of the review of the signed Bilateral Investment Treaty prior to its submission for ratification, our two Governments have discussed the question of compensation for expropriation, under Article III. With regard to the issue of compensation, the Government of Egypt understands that in conformity with contemporary international law, compensation pursuant to Article III paragraph 1 shall be determined in a manner consistent with international legal norms and standards rather than norms and standards that are particular to a specific domestic legal system. I would appreciate confirmation that your government shares this understanding.  
 
Sincerely,  
Dr. KAMAL AHMED EL GANZOURI,  
Minister of Planning and  
International Cooperation.

Dr. KAMAL AHMED EL GANZOURI,  
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation.  
 
DEAR MR. MINISTER:

I have the honor to refer to your letter of March 11, 1985, in which you state that: "With regard to the issue of compensation, the Government of Egypt understands that in conformity with contemporary international law, compensation pursuant to Article II paragraph 1 shall be determined in a manner consistent with international legal norms and standards rather than norms and standards that are particular to a specific  domestic legal system." The understanding you express conforms to the understanding of the Government of the United States regarding the determination of the amount of compensation due to an investor pursuant to Article III of the Bilateral Investment Treaty.  
 
Very truly yours,  
WILLIAM E. BROCK.  
 
I certify this to be a true copy of the original.
