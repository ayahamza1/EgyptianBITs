Such document of admission shall specify the favours, immunities, and conditions which the Contracting Party concerned grants or imposes in respect of the investment admitted. To the extent that the document of admission stipulates deviations from the treatment provided for in Article 2, the provisions of Article 2 shall not be applicable. Applications for foreign investments in the Arab Republic of Egypt should be submitted to the General Authority for Arab and Foreign Investments and Free Zones. 

2. Ad Article 2, 

	(a) The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed" activity" within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 2: the management, maintenance, use, and enjoyment of an investment. The following measures shall, in particular, be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 2 if directed in a discriminatory way against nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party: restricting the purchase of raw or auxiliary materials, of power or fuel or of means of production or operation of any kind, impeding the marketing of products inside or outside the country, as well as any other measures having similar effects. Measures that have to be taken for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed "treatment less favourable" within the meaning of Article 2. 

	(b) Paragraph 2 of Article 2 shall not apply to entry, sojourn and activity as an employee. 

3. Ad Article 3 

The provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 3 shall also apply to any measure of expropriation, nationalisation or dispossession, either direct or indirect, against investments made by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party. Expropriation shall mean the taking away of any property right which in itself or in conjunction with other rights constitutes an investment. 

4. Ad Article 4 

"Liquidation" within the meaning of Article 4 shall be deemed to include any disposal effected for the purposes of completely or partly giving up the investment concerned.

5. Ad Article 4 

In the event of liquidation the capital invested may be retransferred five years after the date stated in the document of admission and at the rate of one fifth a year of the registered value. 

In case the investor, for reasons beyond his control, cannot continue to invest the funds transferred to the 
Arab Republic of Egypt, he may be allowed in this case to transfer his share in the capital to its place of origin after the expiry of one year from the date of its importation and after the approval of the Managing Board of the General Authority. 

6. Ad Article 6

The term "without delay" within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 6 is deemed to be fulfilled if a transfer is made within such period as is normally required for the completion of transfer formalities. The said period shall commence on the day on which the relevant request has been submitted and may on no account exceed two months.

In case of liquidation the said period may on no account exceed six months.
 

7. Ad Articles 2 and 8

	(a) Both Contracting Parties shall come to an understanding in each case with regard to whether the interest held by nationals of either Contracting Party is a substantial interest permitting to exercise control or decisive influence on the company. Should such an understanding not be reached, this case shall be settled under Article 10.

	(c) Without prejudice to any other method of determining nationality, any person in possession of a valid national passport issued by the appropriate authorities of either Contracting Party shall be deemed to be a national of that Party. 


8. Whenever goods or persons connected with the making of investments are to be transported, either Contracting Party shall neither exclude nor hinder transportation enterprises of the other Contracting Party and shall issue permits as required, to carry out such transports.
