## Formatting

All treaty formatting has been standardized to ease readability and interpretation. Some grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb disagreement) remain from their original texts to preserve their integrity.

## BIT Transparency

This index has yet to identify the following BITs:
* Egypt - Saudi Arabia (2024)
* Egypt – Serbia (1977)
* Burundi – Egypt (2012)

## BIT Text Retrieval

The `PyPDF2`, `pdfminer.six`, `pdfplumber`, and `PyMuPDF` Python packages were used to scrape texts from UNCTAD or other available English PDFs. The extractions were cleaned, missing data inputted, and visually cross-referenced with originals.
