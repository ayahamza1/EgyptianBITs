<h1>The Arab Republic of Egypt's Bilateral Investment Treaties: A Complete Index</h1>

<p>Any use or distribution of the database, including the transcriptions, is subject to recognizing Aya Hamza as the original compiler and rightful owner of the database under the

<h2>Formatting</h2>
<p>All treaty formatting has been standardized to ease readability and interpretation. Some grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb disagreement) remain from their original texts so as to preserve their integrity.</p>

<h2>BIT Transparency</h2>
<p>The Egypt - Saudi Arabia (2024), Egypt – Serbia (1977), and Burundi – Egypt (2012) BITs are the only texts this index fails to identify.</p>

<h2>BIT Text Retrieval</h2>
<p>The <code>PyPDF2</code>, <code>pdfminer.six</code>, <code>pdfplumber</code>, and <code>PyMuPDF</code> packages were employed through Python to scrape texts from UNCTAD or otherwise supplied English PDFs when available. The extractions were thoroughly cleaned, missing information diligently inputted, and visually cross-referenced with the original texts.</p>

<h2>Complete Egyptian BIT PDF and Text File Database</h2>
<p>This index relies on the creation of a database with each extracted (and then cleaned or transcribed) treaty text, accompanied with its appropriate PDF regardless of language. For access, please contact <a href="mailto:ahamza3141@gmail.com">ahamza3141@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>Researchers and practitioners should be advised when performing data analysis on the BITs. Namely, the American text reiterates much of the treaty text in its protocol and appendices. Review each text file to discern which contents remain relevant to declared aims.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Rights to individual treaty texts are reserved by their original publisher e.g., Tractatenblad for the Egypt - Netherlands BIT (1996). The present index in its complete form or any reproduction thereof in part must credit Aya Hamza.</p>
